# Plasma
This repository contains code and data for analyzing phase transitions in 2D plasma crystals using structural order parameters and defect analysis.

Description
The plasma crystals are formed by micron-sized particles suspended in an argon gas discharge. As the discharge voltage increases, the particles self-organize into a crystalline lattice. At higher voltages, the crystal eventually melts into a disordered liquid state.

This project aims to characterize the phase transition between solid and liquid states using:

Quantitative image analysis of particle configurations
Calculation of structural order parameters
Identification of topological defects
Key diagnostics include:

Radial distribution function g(r)
Bond orientational order parameter Ïˆ6
Static structure factor S(k)
Topological defect concentrations from Voronoi tessellation
By tracking these metrics during melting, signatures of phase coexistence and spatial heterogeneity across the transition can be identified.
